# ThinkTree

A simple web app for clear decision making.

## How it works

Decision making can be difficult. This app aims to streamline the process. You enter the variables, the uncertainties, and let the app visualize the best option for you. First,

### Add all possible options
On the column on the right. For choosing an occupation, this might be doctor, teacher, software engineer, etc.

### Add factors in consideration.
On the column on the left. E.g. career growth, years to study, salary, reputation, etc.

### Adjust the weights
A software engineering degree typically takes 4 years, with an average salary of $100,000 (probably). A medical degree takes, say 10 years. Input this into the app and let it do the work.

### Deal with uncertainties
Often, decision making is not this straightforward. You might worry about failing medical school, or programming not being your thing. Input the percentage of how likely this is going to happen, and how that would affect your choices if it did.

### Calculate choice
Concise and clear.


## Current TODO:
- Rename 'Depends' to 'Factors'
- Add hints on the columns, "Depends on..." for Factors, "Possible options" for Options
- Heightened visibility of selected Boxes. If a Box (either Factor or Option) is clicked, that box and all its connections should be easily visible. Probably everything else needs to be dulled, and put behind the highlighted components.
